  <h1>Chapter 2: Creating Styles and Style Sheets</h1>
  <h2>2.1. Anatomy of a Style</h2>
  <p>A style is made up of two elements:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Selector - the web page element that the browser formats</li>
    <li>Declaration Block - the actual formatting instructions</li>
  </ol>
  <pre>p { color: red; font-size: 1.5em;}</pre>
  <p>...tells the browser "make the text in all paragraphs red and 1.5 ems tall". Note that "em" is a unit
    of measure based upon a browser's normal text size.</p>
  <h3>Selector</h3>
  <p>Selector tells the browser which element or elements on a page to style. Chapter 3 covers selectors
    in depth.</p>
  <h3>Declaration Block</h3>
  <p>Includes all formatting options you want to apply to the element(s) identified by the Selector.
    Declaration Blocks are made up of one or more "Declarations".</p>
  <h4>Declaration</h4>
  <p>Each Declaration is made up of a "Property" and a "Value". The "Property" is sepearted from the
    "Value" by a colon ':'. Each Declaration is separated from the other Declarations by a semi-colon ';'.</p>
  <p>In the above example the Declaration Block has 2 Declarations.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>color: red;</li>
    <li>font-size: 1.5em;</li>
  </ol>
  <h5>Property</h5>
  <p>A Property is a word, or a few hyphenated words, indicating a certain style effect.</p>
  <p>
    Common properties are: <span style="font-style: italic;">font-style, margin-top, text-align,
      background-color</span>.
  </p>
  <h5>Value</h5>
  <p>The Property dictates the range of legitimate values here. The Property defines what category of
    style we are configuring, the Value contains the specifics. Ex. background-color: blue;</p>
  <h2>2.2. Understanding Style Sheets</h2>
  <p>
    A collection of CSS styles comprises a <span style="font-style: italic;">style sheet</span>. There are 2
    types of sytle sheets.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Internal - Style information is located in the web page itself.</li>
    <li>External - Style information is located in a separate file and linked in the head.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>External sheets are usually the way to go, just don't get caught up in cache problems. Forcing a page
    reload refetches the extenal style sheets. Command-R on Mac. F5 everywhere else, I think.</p>
  <p>Internal style sheets always appear with &lt;style&gt; tags in the page's &lt;head&gt; section.</p>
  <p>The author has an interesting note about &lt;style&gt; relative to &lt;script&gt; tags. He recommends
    that &lt;style&gt; goes first so that the scripts can work with them.</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">ALWAYS END AN EXTERNAL SHEET'S FILENAME WITH
      .css.</span>
  </p>
  <p>There are 2 ways to link an external stylesheet with a page:
  </p>
  <ol>
  <li>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css"/&gt;</li>
  <li>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;<br/>@import url(mystyle.css);<br/>&lt;/style&gt;
  </ol>
  <p>The @import thing works within a stylesheet as well.</p>
  <p>The &lt;link&gt; is more common of the two</p>
