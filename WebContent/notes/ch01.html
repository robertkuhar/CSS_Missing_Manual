  <h1>Chapter 1: Rethinking HTML for CSS</h1>
  <p>The combination of HTML + CSS results in smaller pages and faster downloads.</p>
  <p>HTML is the "structure" of your content. CSS is the style.</p>
  <p>Simple HTML can increase your Search Page ranking</p>
  <p>The &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; tags are like empty vessels that you fill with content</p>
  <h2>&lt;div&gt;-ination</h2>
  <p>A &lt;div&gt; is a block, meaning it has a line break before it and after it</p>
  <p>A &lt;div&gt; indicates any discreet block of content...more often it's used to group any number of
    other elements, so you can insert a headline, a bunch of paragraphs, and a bulleted list inside a single
    &lt;div&gt; block.</p>
  <p>A &lt;div&gt; is a great way to divide a page into logical areas, like 'banner', 'footer', 'sidebar',
    and so on. CSS can then be used to position each of these logical areas.</p>
  <h2>&lt;span&gt;-sters</h2>
  <p>A &lt;span&gt; appears inline as part of a paragraph</p>
  <p>Treat &lt;span&gt; like any other inline elements like &lt;a&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;</p>
  <h2>HTML to forget</h2>
  <p>The 'hit list' includes: &lt;font&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;</p>
  <p>Interestingly enough, &lt;strong&gt; stays!?!</p>
  <p>&lt;table&gt; is on shakey ground with him, use it only if you are presenting tabular data.</p>
  <p>&lt;body&gt; loses most of its attributes</p>
  <p>Forget about &lt;br&gt;</p>
  <p>We will learn to rely upon CSS alone to control text placement, borders, backgrounds, and image
    alignment.</p>
  <h2>Rules of thumb</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Use only one &lt;h1&gt; per page</li>
    <li>Use &lt;p&gt; tag for paragraphs of text</li>
    <li>Use unordered lists &lt;ul&gt; to indicate steps in a process or define the order of a set of
      items.</li>
    <li>Glossaries of terms and definitions should be handled with 'definition list' and 'definition
      term'; &lt;dt&gt; and &lt;dl&gt; respectively.</li>
    <li>&lt;blockquote&gt; is appropriate for long quoted passages. &lt;q&gt; for one liners. The
      &lt;blockquote&gt; appears to work like a paragraph.</li>
    <li>&lt;cite&gt; for referencing a book title</li>
    <li>&lt;address&gt; for contact information and physical address.</li>
    <li>Validate your crap: the <a href="http://validator.w3.org">http://validator.w3.org</a> or get a
      browser plug-in.</li>
    <li>Don't overuse &lt;div&gt;. Consider &lt;ul&gt; for the sidebar, for example.</li>
    <li>Be dilligent about closing tags.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>&lt;address&gt; stuff</h3>
  <p>The &lt;address&gt; tag does not appear to work inline with a paragraph. If anything, it appears to
    work as if it was a paragraph.</p>

    DOCTYPE remains a mess all the way into 2011.  HTML5 simplifies it, but I noticed that even gmail
    has a header to prompt IE to handle its HTML5 in something other than quirks mode.
    Unfortunately, the header the author uses doesn't make it through W3's validator.  Surprising.  I'm going
    to try to do this all as HTML5 and see how this works in the browsers I have.
