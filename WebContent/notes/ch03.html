  <h1>Chapter 3: Selectors: Identifying What to Style</h1>
  <p>
    Selectors in CSS allow you to specify <span class="italics">what</span> you want to format.
  </p>
  <h2>Tag Selectors: Page-Wide Styling</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tag Selectors are aka. "Type" or "Element" selectors</li>
    <li>Efficient because they affect every occurrence of a tag on a page</li>
    <li>"In essence, a tag selector redefines how a browser displays a particular tag."</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Class Selectors: Pinpoint Control</h2>
  <p>You create a Class Selector by just giving it a unique name and some property/value attributes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Class Selectors allow you to pinpoint the exact elements on a page you wish to affect regardless
      of the tag of those elements.</li>
    <li>Unlike tag selectors, you can create as many class selectors as you like and put them anywhere on
      the page.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">All class selector names must begin with a period.</span> After the period the
      name must always start with a letter.</li>
    <li>CSS permits only letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores in class names</li>
    <li>Class names are case sensitive.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To use a class style, you must add a class attribute to the HTML tag you wish to style (or to a
    &lt;span&gt; that you wrap the content you wish to style in)</p>
  <pre>
  &lt;p class="special"&gt;
  </pre>
  <h2 id="id_selectors">ID Selectors: Specific Page Elements</h2>
  <p>
    The ID Selector <span class="italics">identifies</span> a specific part of the page to be affected by the
    format.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript can benefit from elements on the page having specific IDs</li>
    <li>From a purely CSS viewpoint, IDs don't get you much that Class Selectors couldn't be used for.'</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Rules of thumb when considering Class vs ID Selectors...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To use a style multiple times on a page, you must use Classes.</li>
    <li>To use a style exactly once, for ever and ever, use IDs</li>
    <li>Consider ID selector to sidestep style conflicts, since <span class="italics bold">"web
        browsers give ID selectors priority over Class selectors</span>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <span class="italic bold">Note:</span> It is not valid HTML if an ID appears more than once on a page, the
    validators will fail, but most web browsers accept this fact and deal with it.
  </p>
  <pre>
  #banner {
      background: #CC0000;
      height: 300px;
      width: 720px;
  }
  ...
  &lt;div id="banner"&gt;
  </pre>
  <h3>&lt;div&gt; tags</h3>
  <p>
    A &lt;div&gt; tag identifies a logical division of the page, like a banner, navigation bar, sidebar, or
    footer. These are also called <span class="italics">block-level</span> elements because they form a
    complete "block" of conents (with line breaks before and after them). The &lt;div&gt; tag works just like
    a &lt;p&gt; tag.
  </p>
  <p>
    A &lt;div&gt; tag has the unique ability to contain <span class="italics">several</span> block-level
    elements, making it a great way to group tags that are logically related (like logo and nav bar). Once
    grouped in this way, you can apply specific formatting to the tags inside the group.
  </p>
  <h3>Other reasons for IDs</h3>
  <p>IDs allow you to reference elements directly with Javascript rather than having to XPath or JQuery
    Selector locate them.</p>
  <p>
    IDs also allow you to provide "jump here" hyperlinks (I thought only anchors did this). If this is true,
    clicking <a href="ch03.html#id_selectors">here</a> should take us back to the &lt;h2
    id="id_selectors"&gt;ID Selectors: Specific Page Elements&lt;/h2&gt; at the head of this section.
  </p>
  <h2>Group Selectors: Styling groups of Tags</h2>
  <p>Group Selectors allow you to apply a style to multiple selectors at the same time</p>
  <pre>
  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { color: #F1CD33; }
  </pre>
  <p>There is nothing stopping you from having a Group Selector specify some of a tags format and then
    having an ID selector or Tag Selector provide other formatting. (I think they can even override each
    other, but the author has yet to explain the rules).</p>
  <p>You can group dissimilar selectors in this way</p>
  <pre>
  h1, p,.copyright, #banner { color: #F1CD33; }
  </pre>
  <h2>The Universal Selector (Astertisk)</h2>
  <p>
    The '*' is special. It applies to <span class="italics">every single tag</span>. Sounds dangerous.
  </p>
  <pre>
  * { font-weight: bold; }
