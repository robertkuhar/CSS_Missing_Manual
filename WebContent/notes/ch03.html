  <h1>Chapter 3: Selectors: Identifying What to Style</h1>
  <p>
    Selectors in CSS allow you to specify <span class="italics">what</span> you want to format.
  </p>
  <h2>Tag Selectors: Page-Wide Styling</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tag Selectors are aka. "Type" or "Element" selectors</li>
    <li>Efficient because they affect every occurrence of a tag on a page</li>
    <li>"In essence, a tag selector redefines how a browser displays a particular tag."</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Class Selectors: Pinpoint Control</h2>
  <p>You create a Class Selector by just giving it a unique name and some property/value attributes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Class Selectors allow you to pinpoint the exact elements on a page you wish to affect regardless
      of the tag of those elements.</li>
    <li>Unlike tag selectors, you can create as many class selectors as you like and put them anywhere on
      the page.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">All class selector names must begin with a period.</span> After the period the
      name must always start with a letter.</li>
    <li>CSS permits only letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores in class names</li>
    <li>Class names are case sensitive.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To use a class style, you must add a class attribute to the HTML tag you wish to style (or to a
    &lt;span&gt; that you wrap the content you wish to style in)</p>
  <pre>
  .special { font-weight: bold; }
  ...
  &lt;p class="special"&gt;
  </pre>
  <h2 id="id_selectors">ID Selectors: Specific Page Elements</h2>
  <p>
    The ID Selector <span class="italics">identifies</span> a specific part of the page to be affected by the
    format.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript can benefit from elements on the page having specific IDs</li>
    <li>From a purely CSS viewpoint, IDs don't get you much that Class Selectors couldn't be used for.'</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Rules of thumb when considering Class vs ID Selectors...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To use a style multiple times on a page, you must use Classes.</li>
    <li>To use a style exactly once, for ever and ever, use IDs</li>
    <li>Consider ID selector to sidestep style conflicts, since <span class="italics bold">"web
        browsers give ID selectors priority over Class selectors</span>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <span class="italic bold">Note:</span> It is not valid HTML if an ID appears more than once on a page, the
    validators will fail, but most web browsers accept this fact and deal with it.
  </p>
  <pre>
  #banner {
      background: #CC0000;
      height: 300px;
      width: 720px;
  }
  ...
  &lt;div id="banner"&gt;
  </pre>
  <h3>&lt;div&gt; tags</h3>
  <p>
    A &lt;div&gt; tag identifies a logical division of the page, like a banner, navigation bar, sidebar, or
    footer. These are also called <span class="italics">block-level</span> elements because they form a
    complete "block" of conents (with line breaks before and after them). The &lt;div&gt; tag works just like
    a &lt;p&gt; tag.
  </p>
  <p>
    A &lt;div&gt; tag has the unique ability to contain <span class="italics">several</span> block-level
    elements, making it a great way to group tags that are logically related (like logo and nav bar). Once
    grouped in this way, you can apply specific formatting to the tags inside the group.
  </p>
  <h3>Other reasons for IDs</h3>
  <p>IDs allow you to reference elements directly with Javascript rather than having to XPath or JQuery
    Selector locate them.</p>
  <p>
    IDs also allow you to provide "jump here" hyperlinks (I thought only anchors did this). If this is true,
    clicking <a href="ch03.html#id_selectors">here</a> should take us back to the &lt;h2
    id="id_selectors"&gt;ID Selectors: Specific Page Elements&lt;/h2&gt; at the head of this section.
  </p>
  <h2 id="group_selectors">Group Selectors: Styling groups of Tags</h2>
  <p>
    <span class="italics">Group Selectors</span> allow you to apply a style to multiple selectors at the same
    time
  </p>
  <pre>
  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { color: #F1CD33; }
  </pre>
  <p>There is nothing stopping you from having a Group Selector specify some of a tags format and then
    having an ID selector or Tag Selector provide other formatting. (I think they can even override each
    other, but the author has yet to explain the rules).</p>
  <p>You can group dissimilar selectors in this way</p>
  <pre>
  h1, p,.copyright, #banner { color: #F1CD33; }
  </pre>
  <h2>The Universal Selector (Astertisk)</h2>
  <p>
    The '*' is special. It applies to <span class="italics">every single tag</span>. Sounds dangerous.
  </p>
  <pre>
  * { font-weight: bold; }
  </pre>
  <h2 id="desc_selectors">Descendent Selectors: Styling Tags with Tags</h2>
  <p>
    <span class="italics">Descendent Selectors</span> - Format a whole bunch of tags in a similar manner, but
    leave others of the same type alone. Descendent Selectors let you format a tab based upon its relationship
    to other tags.
  </p>
  <pre>
  h1 strong { color: red; }
  </pre>
  <p>The above has the effect of styling any text inside of &lt;strong&gt; tags red only if they are
    contained within an &lt;h1&gt; tag.</p>
  <pre>
  ul li a { font-family: Arial; } 
  </pre>
  <p>The above targets anchors within unordered lists.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold italics">Note:</span><span class="italics"> in general it is best to write as
      short a descendent selector as possible.</span>
  </p>
  <p>You are also not limited to just tag selectors when building your descendent selectors. Consider...</p>
  <pre>
  p.intro a { color: yellow; }
  </pre>
  <p>...which turns &lt;a&gt; tags yellow that occur with &lt;p&gt; of class "intro"</p>
  <h2>Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements</h2>
  <p>Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements allow you to style some tags via well known attributes</p>
  <h3>Styles for Links</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="bold">a:link</span> - selects any link the user has not yet visited.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">a:visited</span> - selects any link the user has visited, according to the
      browser's history.</li>
    <li id="id_hover"><span class="bold">a:hover</span> - allows you to change the look of the link as
      the mouse passes over. AKA. Rollover effect.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">a:active</span> - allows you to change the look of the link at the moment the
      user clicks and before he releases.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <span class="bold italics">Note:</span><span class="italics"> You can use the :hover pseudo-class
      on elements other than links, but beware IE when not in standards mode.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">BEYOND THIS POINT, the Selectors become less useful</span>.
    Some are rarely used, mostly because IE doesn't support them in any consistent manner until IE8 and
    beyond.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="bold">p:first-letter</span> - :first-letter pseudo-element lets you create a drop
      cap, an initial letter that jumps out from the rest of the paragraph with bigger or bolder font
      formatting, as at the beginning of a book chapter.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">p:first-line</span> - :first-line of a paragraph in a different color keeps
      your reader's eye moving and makes text appear appealing and fresh</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>:before and :after</h4>
  <p>
    The <span class="bold">:before</span> pseudo-element allows you to add content <span class="italics">before</span>
    some tag; <span class="bold">:after</span> allows it <span class="italics">after</span>. <span
      class="bold italics">Doesn't work in IE until IE8.</span>.
  </p>
  <h4>:first-child</h4>
  <p>
    The <span class="bold">:first-child</span> pseudo-element allows you to select just the first of "sibling"
    tags for formatting.
  </p>
  <pre>
  li:first-child { font-weight: bold; }
  </pre>
  <h4>:focus</h4>
  <p>
    The <span class="bold">:focus</span> pseudo-class works a lot like the <a href="ch03.html#id_hover"
      class="bold">:hover</a> pseudo-class above.
  </p>
  <p>The :focus selector is mostly useful for giving your visitor feedback, like changing the background
    color of a text box to indicate where he's about to type. The following adds a light yellow color to any
    text box a visitor clicks or tabs into...</p>
  <pre>
  input:focus { background-color: #FFFFCC; }
  </pre>
  <h2>Advanced Selectors</h2>
  <span class="bold italics">Thes don't work in IE6.</span>.
  <h3 id="child_selectors">Child Selectors</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="ch03.html#child_selectors" class="italics">Child Selectors</a> are like <a
      href="ch03.html#desc_selectors" class="italics">Descendent Selectors</a>, only more selective. An angle
    bracket '&gt;' indicates the exact relationship between the parent and the child.
  </p>
  <pre>
  body &gt; h2 { font-weight: bold; } 
  </pre>
  <p>The child selector above would select &lt;body&gt;&lt;h2&gt; but not
    &lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;. A descendent selector would have got them both.</p>
  <h3 id="adj_sib_selectors">Adjacent Sibling Selectors</h3>
  <p>
    <span class="italics">Adjacent Sibling Selectors</span> work on the relationship between 2 or more tags
    that are peers of each other in the tree, rather than children as in <a href="ch03.html#child_selectors"
      class="italics">Child Selectors</a> and <a href="ch03.html#desc_selectors" class="italics">Descendent
      Selectors</a>.
  </p>
  <pre>
  h2 + p { font-weight: bold }
  </pre>
  <p>
    The <span class="italics">Adjacent Sibling</span> selector above formats just "<span class="italics bold">This
      is P1</span>" in &lt;h2&gt;Heading&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;<span class="italics bold">This is P1</span>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This
    is P2&lt;/p&gt;.
  </p>
  <h3 id="attrib_selectors">Attribute Selectors</h3>
  <p>CSS provides a way to select tags for formatting using their attributes (like an &lt;img&gt; tag's
    title attribute).</p>
  <pre>
  img[title] { border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; }
  </pre>
  <p>
    The above <span class="italics">Attribute Selector</span> will format all the image tags that have a title
    attribute.
  </p>
  <pre>
  a[href="http://www.cosmofarmer.com"] { color: red; font-weight: bold; }
  </pre>
  <p>
    The above <span class="italics">Attribute Selector</span> will format all the anchor tags that have an
    href attribute with a value of http://www.cosmofarmer.com. The "attribute equals" portion can be somewhat
    regex-y as well like...
  </p>
  <pre>
  a[href$=".pdf"] { background-image: url(doc_codon.png) no-repeat; padding-left: 15px; }
  </pre>
  <p>...which does some formatting to all the anchors with an href that ends in .pdf
  <pre>
  img[src*="headshot"]
  </pre>
  <p>Selects all images which has the word "headshot" somewhere in the file</p>
  <p>
    <span class="italics bold">Note:</span> He never says that the attribute specifiers are actually regex,
    they just have a couple of similarities.
