  <h1>Chapter 5: Managing Multiple Styles: The Cascade</h1>
  <p>
    A basic CSS mechanism known as the <span class="italics">cascade</span> governs how styles interact and
    which styles get precedence when there's a conflict.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the case of conflict, <span class="italics bold">the nearest ancestor wins</span>. In other words, the
    style that's closest to the tag in question is the one that is applied.
  </p>
  <p>Properties from a style specifically applied to a tag beat out any inherited properties.</p>
  <p>Properties from the most specific style win.</p>
  <h2>Specificity formula</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Tag selector is worth <span class="bold">1 point</span>.</li>
    <li>Class selector is worth <span class="bold">10 points</span>.</li>
    <li>ID selector is worth <span class="bold">100 points</span>.</li>
    <li>An inline style is worth <span class="bold">1000 points</span>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    If after all of this there is still a tie, <span class="italics bold">the last style wins</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="italics">!important;</span> on any property in a declaration block shields it from
    specificity overrides. Note that !important applies to a specific property, not an entire style.
  </p>
  <pre>
  #nav a { color: red; }
  a { color: teal !important; }
  </pre>
  <p>The above makes all links on the page, including those inside an element with the #nav id, the color
    of teal.</p>
  <h2>Start with a clean slate</h2>
  <p>
    The author recommends erasing the built in browser formatting an apply your own. This is called "<span
      class="italics">CSS reset</span>" in the industry.
